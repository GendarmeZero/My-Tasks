        From director <b>Vicki Fleming</b> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog
        Rover (voiced by Brinson Lumblebrunt). You may think a boy and his dog learnin
        the true value of friendship sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and
        he's doggone good at it.
