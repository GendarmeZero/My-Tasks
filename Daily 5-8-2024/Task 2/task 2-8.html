<mark>Coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, called programs</mark>, that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to human than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing, debugging (investigating and fixing problems), <u>implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as programs' machine code.</u>

While these are sometimes considered programming, often the term software development is used for this larger overall process - with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and editing of code per se. <mark>Sometimes software development is known as software engineering, especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering</mark> design process.

Programming is, quite literally, all around us. From the take-out we order, to the movies we stream, code enables everyday actions in our lives. Tech companies are no longer recognizable as just software companies instead, they bring food to our door, help us get a taxi, influence outcomes in presidential elections, or act as a personal trainer.
